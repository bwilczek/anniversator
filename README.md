# Anniversator

This is a Hanami learning project. If it turns out successful, it will provide a counter (up/down) for user-defined dates. Example use-cases:

* My birthtday is in *67* days
* It's been *142* days since local team won their game

But that's the future. Hanami has to be mastered first.
